* Idea
A virtual companion, or robotic assistant for those living alone and requiring
personalized in-home care.

* Implementation
The implementation of the idea depends on three different utilities
- Python module =whereami=
- Python web framework Flask
- Typescript web application front-end

** Location-polling
Python module =whereami= derives location-based data based on available wifi
access points. Many devices have on-board wifi cards which could be used to keep
track of the devices location without the need for GPS, or other complicated
hardware for in-home position tracking. Any generic smart watch could be used,
for example, or even a Raspberry PI.

** Flask server
A lightweight Python web framework 

** Web application front-end
